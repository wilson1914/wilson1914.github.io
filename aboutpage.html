			<div class="aboutme">Hi there! My name is Joshua Brown. I have many interests but some of my favorite are listed below.  I love my cat Izze who's picture can be found at the bottom of this page.

			 I went to Grand Rapids Communinity College and then after that I attended Eastern Michigan University.  I was majoring in Communication Technology but wasn't sure if it was the right path for me, although I'm glad I went because that's where I was introduced to coding. We dabbled in HTML & CSS in a Graphic Designs class and I thoroughly enjoyed it! I heard about Grand Circus through a friend and thought it would be a great oppurtunity to start a career as a web developer.<div>
